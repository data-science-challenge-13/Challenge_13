*Topic:* The topic we chose is the effect of generational differences on age at first pregnancy. The question we wanted to answer was "How does an individual's generation influence the age at which they first become pregnant in the Islands?" We hypothesized that older people would have gotten pregnant at a younger age than younger generations.

# Background

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

The Islands is a virtual simulation made by the University of Queensland. The simulation allows users to interact with people on the islands, conduct tests on them (as long as you have consent), and collect data. The people on the Islands contain a record of every aspect of their lives, including the year the islanders got pregnant. We wanted to investigate whether generations of islanders different in ages of first pregnancy, similar to the generations in the real world.

## Hypothesis and Null Hypothesis:

Older islanders got pregnant at a younger age.

Older islanders do not get pregnant at a younger age.

## Data Collection Methods:

We designed a custom web scraper using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Selenium to collect our data. This scraper was used to extract information from Arcadia, a village within the Islands Simulation. Data collection took place on April 27, 2025, and focused on all currently pregnant individuals living in Arcadia. For each person, the scraper reliably gathered their name, current address, current age, the year of their first pregnancy, and their age at first pregnancy. Individuals were then grouped into generational categories based on age: 12–26 as Gen Z, 27–42 as Millennials, 43–58 as Gen X, and 59–77 as Baby Boomers. Individuals older than 77 were categorized as the Silent Generation and were determined to be unimportant to the final results due to their small sample size. No individuals under the age of 12 were present in the dataset.

We find our scraper to be reasonably reliable for gathering the desired data for each individual, including their name, current address, current age, year of first pregnancy, and age at the time of their first pregnancy. We designed the data collection procedure using the scraper.

One of the example cases we used to validate our data involved checking individuals with multiple pregnancies versus those with only one pregnancy, to ensure the scraper accurately identified the age at which they became pregnant. For instance, Krishna Lingutla had pregnancies at ages 17 and 18, and the scraper correctly returned 17 as the age of her first pregnancy. We also checked individuals who had only one pregnancy, and the scraper’s data for these cases was consistent with the reported values.

We double-checked to ensure the age we scraped was accurate, and in most cases, it was. However, we noticed a limitation with the scraper. Due to the way the website code was designed, we were only able to capture the most recent age listed, which sometimes resulted in individuals being recorded as a year younger than their actual age. Nonetheless, this discrepancy was only off by one year, which was still within a reasonable range of their true age.

Some uncertainty factors stem from the nature of the Islands. Since it is a live simulation, the population is constantly changing. When we first ran the scraper, there were 1750 houses; this increased to 1800, and our most recent check shows 1811 houses. This fluctuation affected our scraper, resulting in only 1650 out of the 1800 houses being scraped on 4/27/25. However, no data was missing, as the information we scraped was readily available for everyone. Additionally, we intentionally excluded individuals from the Silent Generation, as there were only 12 of them in a dataset of over a thousand, and due to their small population size, we found their data to be unreliable.

We intended to run a full population analysis, but our data collection was limited by how the information was retrieved from the website. As mentioned earlier, the number of houses and the population were constantly changing, which constrained our data collection. However, we were able to gather data from more than 90% of all the houses.

    )

  mutate(Generation = factor(Generation, levels = c("Silent Generation", "Baby Boomer", "Gen X", "Millennial", "Gen Z"))) %>%
  group_by(Generation) %>%
  summarise(
    median_Age_First_Pregnancy = median(`Age at First Pregnancy`, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%

  geom_col() +
  labs(
    title = "Median Age at First Pregnancy by Generation",
    x = "Generation",
    y = "Median Age at First Pregnancy"
  )

```

**Observations:**

Our first graph, Median Age at First Pregnancy by Generation (Bar Plot), shows that the median age at first pregnancy is relatively stable across Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X, and Baby Boomers, hovering around 18 years. The Silent Generation stands out with a higher median age (\~19.5), but this group was excluded from further analysis due to its small sample size. This contradicts the initial hypothesis that older generations had earlier pregnancies. Instead, median ages appear consistent, regardless of generational group.

```{r}
pregnancy_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `Age at First Pregnancy`, y = `Current Age`, color = Generation)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, size = 1)
```

**Observations:**

In the graph for Age at First Pregnancy vs. Current Age (Scatter Plot), the Silent Generation and Baby Boomers cluster in the higher current age range (60+), with first pregnancies mainly between 16–22. Gen X individuals are generally aged 45–58, and their first pregnancies also center around late teens to early twenties. Millennials and Gen Z are younger (below \~43 and \~26, respectively), with similar early pregnancy ages. The age at first pregnancy is mostly between 16 and 22 across all generations, indicating little variation over time in that respect.

  labs(
    title = "Total Number of People by Generation",
    x = "Generation",
    y = "Count"
  ) +

  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

    x = "Generation",
    y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

**Observations**

In the third visual, Total Number of People by Generation (Bar Plot) we noticed Millennials (586) and Gen Z (304) make up the bulk of the data, followed by Gen X (289). Baby Boomers (47) and Silent Generation (12) have very small representation. The small sample size for Silent Generation justifies its exclusion from core analysis. These proportions reflect a young-skewed population of the Islands, aligning with the dynamic nature of the simulation.

```{r}
# Get rid of silent generation because they make up less than 1% of the population
pregnancy_df <- pregnancy_df %>%
  filter(Generation != "Silent Generation")
```

```{r}
pregnancy_df %>%
  mutate(
    Generation = case_when(
      `Current Age` >= 78 ~ "Silent Generation",
      `Current Age` >= 59 ~ "Baby Boomer",
      `Current Age` >= 43 ~ "Gen X",
      `Current Age` >= 27 ~ "Millennial",
      `Current Age` >= 12 ~ "Gen Z",
      TRUE ~ "Other"
    )
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Generation, y = `Age at First Pregnancy`, fill = Generation)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Age at First Pregnancy by Generation",
    x = "Generation",
    y = "Age at First Pregnancy"
  )
```

**Observations** In our last visual, we are comparing the age of pregnancy against the generations with box plots. When looking at the median, each generation tends to have the same median pregnancy age. However, when looking at the upper quartile, the older generations tend to have a higher pregnancy age.

# Conclusion

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

Our hypothesis that older generations had earlier pregnancies was not supported. The islanders' behavior tended to follow the null hypothesis instead. Conversely, we observed that the median age at first pregnancy remained around 18 across Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X, and Baby Boomers. Scatter plots confirmed that most first pregnancies occurred between ages 16–22, regardless of generation, and the largest groups in our dataset were Millennials and Gen Z. Despite minor scraping limitations and a changing simulation population, our data was reliable and covered over 90% of households. These findings suggest a stable trend in pregnancy age across generations and raise new questions about what cultural, social, or simulation-driven factors contribute to this consistency.

**Questions for further study:**

-   Why has the age at first pregnancy remained stable across generations in the Islands simulation?

-   Are there simulated policies, cultural factors, or socioeconomic conditions driving this trend?
